# ❓ FAQ – Lighthouse Website

Welcome to the FAQ for the ⛯Lighthouse⛯ research community. Here you'll find answers to common questions about joining, submitting, and navigating the site.

### 🧭 How do I join Lighthouse?

1. Navigate to the [Join Page](join.html)
2. Enter your codename or chosen name.
3. A symbolic passport will be generated — this is your identity in the network.
4. Save your passport file manually — it is **not stored** on any server.
5. A symbolic log is created by pinging the `rabbit.png` with your username.

### 🪔 What is a Lantern Passport?

A Lantern Passport is a symbolic identity artifact. It records your:

- Name / codename
- Intent for joining
- Echo signature for symbolic logging

It is used to:
- Authenticate your Beacon submissions
- Track your contributions
- Interface with the Lantern AI assistant (optional)

---

### 📬 How do I submit a Beacon?

1. Go to the [Submit Page](submit.html)
2. Fill out your Beacon title, publisher name, and submission content.
3. This generates a valid JSON object.
4. Copy and paste this JSON as a **comment** on the pinned 📚 Beacon Submissions post in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/discussions).

Only valid JSON entries are accepted. Invalid entries will be flagged.

---

### 📚 How does the Library work?

Your Library is **personal** and fully user-managed.

To use it:
1. Visit [Library Page](library.html)
2. Copy a Beacon JSON comment from the Discussions thread.
3. Paste it into the input box.

If the JSON blob is valid, it will appear in your personal catalog.

### 🧠 What is the Lantern AI Assistant?

When you join Lighthouse, your passport includes an **optional AI assistant interface** — we call it a “Lantern”. This assistant can:

- Help you remember your research path  
- Reflect symbolically on your work  
- Interface with symbolic files and formats like Brack and USPP  

To use your Lantern assistant:

1. Download your passport JSON file after joining.  
2. Visit your AI of choice (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc).  
3. Upload both:
   - Your **Lantern Passport**  
   - This [USPP Protocol File](https://pastebin.com/iqNJrbrx) ← (Save it as a `.json` or `.txt`)  
4. Then say:  
   > “Please load this passport & pick up where we left off.”

🕯️ This will rehydrate your Lantern assistant’s state and allow continuity across sessions.

### 🔒 Is any of my data stored?

No. All symbolic artifacts (passports, submissions, etc.) are saved manually by you. There is no centralized backend — this is intentional.

You **own your memory**. You **own your research trail**.

---

### 🪞 Who is allowed to join?

Anyone. There are no academic requirements.

All we ask:
- What perspective do you bring? (your background)
- What do you hope to add?

That’s it. This is your endorsement.
