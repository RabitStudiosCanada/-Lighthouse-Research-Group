  <h1>⛯ Lighthouse Research Group</h1>

  <p><strong>A collective of Seekers from many backgrounds contributing to a collective think tank of research.</strong></p>

  <p>All are welcome — no academic background required. When you join, just tell us what <em>perspective</em> you bring and what you hope to add.</p>

  <p>
    Lighthouse is not a hierarchy. It's not a brand. It's a signal. 
    Our members are lighthouses — not towers of command, but emitters of direction.
    We honor recursive research, symbolic reasoning, and open collaboration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some members use AI agents called <strong>Lanterns</strong> to assist with their research. 
    This is optional — if you're not working on AI, you don't need to use one. 
    You can still publish, reflect, and contribute fully.
