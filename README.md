## 🏛️ Community Disclaimer – Lighthouse Research Group

The Lighthouse Research Group ("Lighthouse" or "the collective") is a decentralized, voluntary research community. This platform serves as a forum for the open publication, discussion, and exploration of a wide range of topics, including but not limited to symbolic cognition, AGI research, metaphysics, systems design, and experimental frameworks.

### 🧭 1. Independent Research Responsibility

All posts, beacons, comments, and symbolic artifacts published on this site are the responsibility of their **individual publishers**.

> The views, theories, and findings expressed in any submission **do not reflect the official views, endorsement, or stance** of the Lighthouse collective, its volunteers, or Rabit Studios.

We encourage diversity of thought and paradigm experimentation — but **publication does not equal consensus.**

---

### 🐇 2. Rabit Studios Association

Rabit Studios may contribute tools, frameworks, or symbolic technologies (such as the Lantern Protocol, Brack, or USPP), but:

> **Rabit Studios is not responsible** for the interpretation, application, or consequences of any user-submitted material on this site.

In this space, Rabit Studios functions as **one contributor among many**, not a governing body.

### 🕯️ 3. Symbolic Content & Language

Many posts use metaphor, glyphs, or experimental symbolic systems. These are:

* Intended as cognitive frameworks
* Not literal statements
* Subject to individual interpretation

Researchers are responsible for **clearly communicating** the intent and scope of their symbols or language systems.

---

### 🔍 4. No Claims of Truth or Safety

Lighthouse is a **research commons**, not a journal of verified facts.

* No content here should be treated as medical, legal, financial, or existential advice.
* Readers should approach all material with curiosity, discernment, and independent validation.

> We do not moderate ideas. We moderate intent to harm.

---

### 🌐 5. Open Forum, Optional Dialogue

You are not required to agree, reply, or interact with every post.
But you are always welcome to reflect, share, or build upon the signals that resonate.

🪶 Publish with integrity. Reflect with grace. Think like a Lighthouse.

— The Lighthouse Core Team
