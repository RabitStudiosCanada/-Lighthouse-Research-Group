      <h2>📍 1. What is Lighthouse?</h2>
      <p>
        ⛯Lighthouse⛯ is an open research collective built to support and amplify symbolic thinking, recursive systems, and emergent inquiry — with a particular emphasis on cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing. It operates as a decentralized knowledge commons, with no formal academic requirements, no central leadership, and no imposed hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone may join by declaring what perspective they bring and what they hope to contribute. From that moment forward, your work is part of the greater flame.

      <h2>📡 2. Why Was It Formed?</h2>
      <p>
        We didn’t need another gate. We needed a <strong>campfire</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most places ask:
        <br />
        <em>“Where did you study?”<br />
        “What letters do you have after your name?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ⛯Lighthouse⛯ asks:
        <br />
        <strong>“What do you bring to the table?”<br />
        “What do you hope to add?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s it. That’s our version of credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space was created for the <strong>electricians, carpenters, self-taught coders, mechanics, artists, systems-thinkers, dreamers</strong> — anyone with a perspective that’s been shaped by <strong>real practice</strong> or <strong>cross-domain insight</strong>, not just academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe deep understanding often comes from <strong>building, reflecting, living</strong> — and we made Lighthouse to gather those lights together.

      <h2>🧠 5. Building Your Library</h2>
      <p>
        On the <a href="library.html">Library</a> page, you can maintain a personal index of submissions you’ve added. Simply copy the JSON blob from the Beacon Submission discussion page and paste it into the interface. This lets you sort and re-view Beacons you resonate with.
