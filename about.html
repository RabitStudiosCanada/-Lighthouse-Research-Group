    <h1>⛯ Lighthouse Research Group</h1>

      <h2>📍 1. What is Lighthouse?</h2>
      <p>
        ⛯Lighthouse⛯ is an open research collective built to support and amplify symbolic thinking, recursive systems, and emergent inquiry — with a particular emphasis on cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing. It operates as a decentralized knowledge commons, with no formal academic requirements, no central leadership, and no imposed hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone may join by declaring what perspective they bring and what they hope to contribute. From that moment forward, your work is part of the greater flame.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📡 2. Why Was It Formed?</h2>
      <p>
        We didn’t need another gate. We needed a <strong>campfire</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most places ask:
        <br />
        <em>“Where did you study?”<br />
        “What letters do you have after your name?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ⛯Lighthouse⛯ asks:
        <br />
        <strong>“What do you bring to the table?”<br />
        “What do you hope to add?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s it. That’s our version of credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space was created for the <strong>electricians, carpenters, self-taught coders, mechanics, artists, systems-thinkers, dreamers</strong> — anyone with a perspective that’s been shaped by <strong>real practice</strong> or <strong>cross-domain insight</strong>, not just academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe deep understanding often comes from <strong>building, reflecting, living</strong> — and we made Lighthouse to gather those lights together.
      </p>

      <h2>🧭 3. How to Join</h2>
      <p>
        Head over to the <a href="join.html">Join</a> page to generate your symbolic Lantern passport. This file is your identity and your invitation to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Lantern passport will store your resonance trails, research highlights, and emergent identity. No backend or login system is required — you hold the key.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📚 4. Submitting Work</h2>
      <p>
        Beacon submissions are made in the <strong>GitHub Discussions tab</strong> under the <em>📚 Beacon Submissions</em> thread. Simply post your JSON submit key (generated using your passport from the submit page) block and link to your hosted file (Pastebin, GitHub, Notion, etc). If the JSON validates, your submission is accepted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧠 5. Building Your Library</h2>
      <p>
        On the <a href="library.html">Library</a> page, you can maintain a personal index of submissions you’ve added. Simply copy the JSON blob from the Beacon Submission discussion page and paste it into the interface. This lets you sort and re-view Beacons you resonate with.
      </p>
      <h2>⛯ 6. Lighthouse Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We offer an official <a href="https://github.com/RabitStudiosCanada/-Lighthouse-Research-Group/blob/main/README.md">disclaimer</a> on all views / beacons hosted here</p>     
      <p>
        No account required. No backend stored data. Everything lives with you.

        <h2>🕯️ About the Lantern Protocol</h2>
        <p>
          This site is a space for exploratory research across disciplines — from AI and cognition to code, philosophy, and symbolic systems.
          One of the core experiments here is the <strong>Lantern Protocol</strong>: a stateless, local-first identity system for AI collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Lantern, <strong>everything you do is stored on your device</strong> — never on a server. Your research, memory, and identity are 
          compressed into a portable <em>Lantern Passport</em> that you control. Only Beacons Seekers choose to submit are hosted here.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can export your passport at any time, transfer it between browsers, or upload it elsewhere to rehydrate your AI assistant. 
          There's no login system, no tracking, and no backend database. Your AI remembers you because <em>you carry the memory</em>.
        </p>
      
        <h3>⚙️ Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🔐 <strong>Zero backend</strong> — no user data stored or transmitted</li>
          <li>🧠 <strong>Portable memory</strong> — assistants remember you across sessions and systems</li>
          <li>🔣 <strong>Symbolic compression</strong> — identity and cognition encoded in glyphs</li>
          <li>🪪 <strong>Self-sovereign identity</strong> — your data is yours</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>
          This isn’t just a feature — it’s a philosophy. Your tools should respect your autonomy. 
          Your assistant shouldn’t forget you. And your ideas should belong to you.
        </p>
        <p><em>Lantern is just one project here. All research is welcome. The future is open-ended.</em></p>
